# JTube Deployment Guide

## ðŸš€ Making JTube Publicly Accessible

### Option 1: Local Network Access (Quick Start)
Your app is now accessible on your local network at:
- **Your IP:** http://192.168.0.243:3000 (frontend)
- **API:** http://192.168.0.243:5000 (backend)

Anyone on your WiFi network can access it using your IP address.

### Option 2: Cloud Deployment (Recommended for Public Access)

#### A. Deploy to Vercel (Frontend) + Railway/Render (Backend)

**Frontend (Vercel):**
1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Connect GitHub to Vercel
3. Deploy the `client` folder
4. Update API URLs to point to your backend

**Backend (Railway/Render):**
1. Deploy the backend to Railway or Render
2. Set environment variables
3. Update CORS settings

#### B. Deploy to Heroku (Full Stack)
```bash
# Install Heroku CLI
# Create a Procfile
echo "web: node server/server.js" > Procfile

# Deploy
heroku create your-jtube-app
git push heroku main
```

#### C. Deploy to DigitalOcean/AWS (VPS)
- Rent a VPS ($5-20/month)
- Install Node.js and PM2
- Set up nginx reverse proxy
- Configure SSL with Let's Encrypt

### Option 3: Tunneling Services (Quick & Free)

#### Using ngrok (Easiest for testing):
```bash
# Install ngrok
# In terminal 1: Start your servers
npm run dev

# In terminal 2: Tunnel backend
ngrok http 5000

# In terminal 3: Tunnel frontend  
ngrok http 3000
```

#### Using Cloudflare Tunnel:
```bash
# Install cloudflared
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000
```

### Option 4: Self-Hosting (Advanced)

#### Requirements:
- Static IP or Dynamic DNS
- Port forwarding on router
- Domain name (optional)
- SSL certificate

#### Steps:
1. Configure router port forwarding (ports 3000, 5000)
2. Set up firewall rules
3. Configure domain DNS (if using custom domain)
4. Set up SSL with Let's Encrypt

### Production Checklist:
- [ ] Environment variables configured
- [ ] CORS properly set up
- [ ] File upload limits appropriate
- [ ] Error handling implemented
- [ ] Database instead of in-memory storage
- [ ] User authentication (recommended)
- [ ] SSL certificate (HTTPS)
- [ ] Backup strategy for uploaded videos
- [ ] CDN for video delivery (optional)

### Security Considerations:
- Change default ports in production
- Implement rate limiting
- Add user authentication
- Validate all file uploads
- Use HTTPS only
- Regular security updates
- Monitor for abuse

### Scaling Considerations:
- Use a proper database (PostgreSQL/MongoDB)
- Implement cloud storage (AWS S3/Cloudinary)
- Add video compression/transcoding
- Implement CDN for global delivery
- Load balancing for high traffic
